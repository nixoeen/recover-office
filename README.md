Fixing the office files which cannot be opened anymore.

# Problem
Since 06.11.2023 I had the issue that some Microsoft Office files couldn't be opened, though they could be opened without any issues on other computers. Microsoft Office files (.docx, .xlsx and .pptx) are ZIP archive files. Extracting and compressing the files solved the issue. To make the process easier for users, I wrote a software to do the process automatically.

# Installation
Copy recover-office.exe to "C:\Program Files\" and import recover-office.reg.

# Usage
Right-Click on the file which should be repaired and click on Recover Office File. The file will be renamed with the addition "-Backup" and the new file will be generated.
